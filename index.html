    <h2>Why I chose Boise</h2>
    <p>I was not born in Boise, Idaho. I was born in Moscow, Russia. Ethnically Uzbek. The reason I chose Boise Idaho was because I have lived basically my whole life in this town/area. Moved to the US in 2006. I was born in 2005 meaning I was just a couple months old when I came to the US. Even though I was not born in this city or town I have lived more than half my life here. That is why I say Boise Idaho is my hometown</p>
